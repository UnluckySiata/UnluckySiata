# Hey!
My name is Miko≈Çaj and I am a CS student from Poland.
Some of the things I enjoy the most in software development are:
- network and low-level programming 
- writing efficient and fault-tolerant code
- customizable dev environments
- using technologies with great tooling around them

What is important to me is to have a fine understanding of my general development
environment and the technologies that I use.
That is why I also appreciate simplicity in software and I try to keep that in mind while writing it :).

My favourites for a tech stack currently are:

    <img height="32" width="32" src="https://unpkg.com/simple-icons@v11/icons/rust.svg"/>
    <img height="32" width="32" src="https://unpkg.com/simple-icons@v11/icons/elixir.svg"/>

And there are some things that I use on a daily-basis:
